## Retrospective 
I've captured what can be improved on my code sorted by language (as of now only *GO*).

### Go 
- need to think beyond struct & receiver methods - better composition techniques
- drastically improve DS skills like using more efficient algos and DS for matrix operations
	- effective use of trees in place of slices
- more concurrent for day 4 espeically - may be ok for AOC but in general ;-)
- move DRY'ed functions to `utils.go`
- advice from vinay
	- don't overthink the problem beyond scope
	- try to be bit mathematical while solving problems than organizing code
